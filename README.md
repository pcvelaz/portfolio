The goal of this project was to create two clock displays.  One with a 12 hour display and one with 24.  One thing I did particularly well was that I took care to format the output in a way that was very neat and readable.  Looking back at the code, I could have pulled most of the lines in main out into its own function, minimizing the code in main which is a good practice.  Planning out the code was the most difficult part for me, as it feels overwhelming at first and I have to resist the temptation to just start coding and let the project develop itself.  As time goes on I am getting more practice visualizing the necessary steps to complete a project like this one.  The code in this project is neat and well organized, which is a skill I am also getting better at and an important one for working in the field.  Writing clean, easy to read code is important when working with others in a professional environment as it makes the code maintainable as well.  This is a very transferrable skill that I will be taking with me as I continue to develop my coding skills.
