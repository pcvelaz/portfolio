The goal of this project was to step into the role of a technology consultant to help an organization called The Gaming Room expand their application to multiple operating systems. The application was a game that required the use of large libraries to render images at a set speed for many users.  One thing I did well in this project was that I spent a lot of time researching the various operating systems to make recommendations on how to expand and what kind of server structure to use.  The submitted design document was helpful in providing clarity as I worked on this project.  I kept the needs of the business in mind when making my recommendations by comparing the costs of different options, and factoring those costs into my recommendations.  In future software design situations, I will be able to apply what I've learned about the differences between some of the most common operating systems to make informed choices.
